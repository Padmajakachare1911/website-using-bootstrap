design and implement a web-site using Bootstrap and
hand-coded HTML. It should meet the following requirements:
• It should have three separate HTML pages that are linked to each other.
• Other than the three pages, other links do not need to work, and the text can be
“lorem ipsum” (fake).
• Among the three pages there should be at least 4 images.

• New: At least one page should use a multiple-column layout, achieved using Boot-
strap’s grid.

• It should use additional bootstrap visual features such as buttons, badges, a table, or
a form.
• It should resize gracefully on smaller devices.
